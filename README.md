### Project Title
Python Bike Share Project

### Description
This project makes use of Python and associated libraries, Pandas and Numpy to explore data
related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City,
and Washington. It imports the data and answers interesting questions about it by computing
descriptive statistics. The script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience for
a user to ask questions like what age groups are the market for sharing bikes, what are the
most popular beginning and ending trips, and what is an average time any one trip will
typically last.  The user interacts with the script to direct which of the 3 major city’s data
to explore, and any time slice of interest to determine, for example, what the most popular months,
days of the week, and times of day are in those cities.

### Files used
Data files containing just under 1 million time-stamped bike rental trips:

- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

Program Libraries:

- Python executable in an Anaconda environment
- Python standard libraries such as Time and Calendar Modules
- Pandas
- Numpy
